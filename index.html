          <p>
            Village Life Matters (VILLIMA, INC) was founded in 2020 by the president, Sylvester Ochieng. VILLIMA, INC germinated out of Sylvester’s love and passion 
            for the forgotten poor whom he has been meeting and working with throughout his life journey. He has met and worked with the forgotten poor within the 
            rural villages and inner Cities of Africa, within the “Bible Belt” States and within the inner cities of the United States.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Before coming to the United States, Sylvester lived and worked with the forgotten poor of Gallapo village and of the inner city of Arusha-Tanzania. 
            Likewise, he lived and worked with the forgotten poor of Uyoma Village and of the inner city of Nairobi-Kenya. Upon his arrival in the United Sates, 
            the love and passion for the forgotten poor took Sylvester to the “Bible Belt” States where he had first-hand experience with poverty while living 
            and working with seasonal immigrant workers and the Native Americans.  Sylvester later relocated to the Nation’s Capital, Washington DC, where he 
            came face to face with the urban poor and poverty. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout his life, Sylvester has been moved by the firsthand experience of harsh living conditions of the poor and has developed a natural sense 
            of community and service.  He reports, “living among the forgotten poor has shaped my values and the direction of life. Wherever I travel to, 
            I always find myself in the midst of the poor. And as a rule of nature, I have learned to assimilate with them and to live for them”. 
            Sylvester believed that there was no other better way of fighting poverty in his life journey but through VILLIMA, INC, Thus, VILLIMA, INC 
            was legally founded and incorporated in the State of Maryland as a Tax-Exempt non-stock corporation.

              <p>
                At <strong>VILIMA INC</strong>, we fight poverty among the forgotten poor by aligning stakeholders from local healthcare providers, government, and the communities with a goal to improve health. We invest in 
                understanding what drives community-level needs and how those needs impact individuals in the community. Continuously, we build targeted networks of resources; medical equipment, medication, 
                and personnel know how that meet the unique needs of every community we serve. In every community where we are present, our targeted centers include service to the elderly, HIV/AIDS patients, 
                disabled children, addiction centers, nutrition centers, and other social health services.

              <p>
                At <strong>VILIMA INC</strong>, we do believe that leaving the environment in a better condition than we found it is another way of fighting poverty among the forgotten poor.  Across sub-Saharan Africa, human 
                activities such us lumbering and charcoal burning has depleted the soil coverage which can no longer sustain meaningful agriculture. We correct the environmental damages by educating the local 
                communities on restoration practices including; tree planting and restoration of river water drainage systems.

              <p>
                <strong>VILIMA INC</strong>, is a proponent of Housing First Model (HFM) and we do believe that poverty cannot be fought among the forgotten poor without having a roof over our heads. Having a decent and affordable 
                shelter frees families from physical and mental hardships, increases quality of life, confidence, and self-reliance.  We are called to go to the most vulnerable villages and/or inner cities, to 
                evaluate housing needs and to help the families there build and/or improve quality and affordable shelters. Through our services, we ensure that no family gets soaked by rainstorm and incessantly 
                bitten by bugs including mosquitoes.

                <strong>VILIMA INC</strong> continues fighting poverty among the forgotten poor by planting seeds of brighter future through sustainable agriculture.  Being moved by the harsh reality of poor families, we have concluded 
                that providing them with food donations alone will not solve their problems. We are present in the forgotten poor communities providing families with tools like hoes, fertilizer, irrigation kits, and 
                harvesting equipment. We train families on improved and modern farming methods with emphasis on fast-growing, drought-resistant seeds.

                we diligently work to reduce the number of complications that has led to death of many family members.  We strive to provide families with clean water source, save lives and build healthier communities. We educate families 
                on sanitation and hygiene and also provide them with water wells, purification systems, hygienic sanitation facilities, and cisterns.

                <strong>VILIMA, INC</strong> take pride in fighting poverty among the forgotten poor by replenishing resources of families whose finances has already been depleted by crisis. We meet families with unique set of challenges; death of a family 
                member, behavioral and emotional difficulties, relationship problems, violent or threatening domestic situations, loneliness, depression, chemical dependency issues etc.  that at times requires instant intervention.  
                We assess case by case crisis culturally and intervene competently using strength-based approach to aid recovery, and re-gain confidence.  We teach families who are going through crisis mental 
                health awareness and provide them with supportive counseling.
